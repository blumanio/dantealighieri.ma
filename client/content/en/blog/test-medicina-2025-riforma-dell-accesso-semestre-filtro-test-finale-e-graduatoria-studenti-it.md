**Big Changes for Medical School Admissions in 2025-26**  

Starting in the 2025-26 academic year, aspiring medical, dentistry, and veterinary students will face a major overhaul in the admissions process. The traditional multiple-choice entrance exam is being replaced by a new system designed to be fairer, more merit-based, and better at guiding students toward the right path.  

### **Key Changes in the New System**  
- **No More Traditional Entrance Test** â€“ The old multiple-choice exam is gone, but admission caps remain.  
- **Introductory "Filter Semester"** â€“ All students can enroll in the first semester, but progression to the second semester depends on exam results and a national ranking based on earned credits.  
- **Alternative Paths** â€“ Students who donâ€™t advance can still use their credits for related degree programs.  
- **More Doctors in Training** â€“ The reform aims to train 30,000 new doctors over the next seven years.  

### **How the New System Works**  
1. **First Semester (Open to All)** â€“ Students take foundational courses.  
2. **Mid-Year Exam (Semi-Open Questions)** â€“ Around Christmas, a test determines who moves forward.  
3. **Ranking & Placement** â€“ Admission to the second semester depends on grades and credits earned.  

### **What If You Donâ€™t Pass the First Semester?**  
- Credits earned can be transferred to other degree programs (e.g., biology, nursing).  
- The Ministry of Education will define which alternative courses accept these credits.  

### **Private Universities Keep Their Own Exams**  
While public universities transition to the new system, private institutions (like Unicamillus, Humanitas, and Cattolica) have already announced their 2025 admission test dates.  

### **Possible Delays & Alternative Plans**  
If the reform isnâ€™t fully implemented by 2025, the government may temporarily reintroduce the 2024 model (two test dates with a public question bank).  

### **New High School Preparation (PCTO)**  
Students in their last three years of high school can participate in healthcare-focused internships (PCTO), earning credits that count toward their first semester at university.  

### **National Exam Standards**  
To ensure fairness, the government is considering standardized national exams to prevent grading disparities between universities.  

### **Important Dates for 2025 (Private Universities)**  
- **Unicamillus:** July 3 (Medicine), July 4 (Medicine in English)  
- **Humanitas:** February 5 & 26  
- **Campus Bio-Medico:** January 10 & February 21  
- **Cattolica:** February 28 & April 11  
*(More dates may be announced soon.)*  

### **Final Thoughts**  
This reform aims to reduce the "luck factor" of entrance exams and give students more flexibility. However, uncertainties remainâ€”especially regarding implementation timelines. Stay tuned for updates as the government finalizes the details!
